# CS150-Capstone

# Wesley House Unit Manager (Phase 1)

This C++ application is part of a capstone project designed to manage residential units in a nonprofit apartment building (e.g., Wesley House in San Diego). It tracks tenants, occupancy, and rent.

## Files
- `HousingUnit.h` – Class header file
- `HousingUnit.cpp` – Class implementation
- `main.cpp` – Test harness for the class

## Resources
- [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
- GitHub Copilot
- ChatGPT – for help with class design and code structure

## Summary
**What went well:** Mapping the real-world idea of apartment management to class-based C++ code.

**Challenges:** Keeping class responsibilities clear — keeping rent and tenant logic separate from potential future maintenance logic.

**Future Work:** Add maintenance requests, lease duration, or monthly reports.
