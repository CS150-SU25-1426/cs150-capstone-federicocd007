# CS150-Capstone

# Wesley House Unit Manager (Phase 1)

This C++ application is part of a capstone project designed to manage residential units in a nonprofit apartment building (e.g., Wesley House in San Diego). It tracks tenants, occupancy, and rent.

## Files
- `HousingUnit.h` – Class header file
- `HousingUnit.cpp` – Class implementation
- `main.cpp` – Test harness for the class

## Resources
- [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
- GitHub Copilot
- ChatGPT – for help with class design and code structure

## Summary
**What went well:** Mapping the real-world idea of apartment management to class-based C++ code.

**Challenges:** Keeping class responsibilities clear — keeping rent and tenant logic separate from potential future maintenance logic.

**On Time**: As I am still catching up in the class, most of my deliverables are late right now.

**Future Work:** Add maintenance requests, lease duration, or monthly reports.

# Wesley House Unit Manager – Phase 2

This C++ application models the management of a 12-unit nonprofit apartment building in San Diego. The app allows staff to add, edit, delete, and view unit information, including tenants and rent.

## Features
- Manage units with tenant name, occupancy status, and rent
- Full menu-based UI for adding, editing, deleting, and viewing units
- Vector-based list to manage up to 12 units
- Operator overloading for usability

## Files
- `HousingUnit.h/cpp`: Represents a single housing unit
- `HousingUnitList.h/cpp`: Manages a list of housing units
- `main.cpp`: Interactive menu

## Resources
- [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com)
- GitHub Copilot
- ChatGPT (structure and logic validation)
- Stack Overflow

## Summary
**What went well:** Code modularity and testing in parts before integrating.

**Challenges:** Designing a user-friendly menu that was still simple and console-based. Operator overloading logic for lists was initially unclear.

**On Time**: As I am still catching up in the class, most of my deliverables are late right now.

**Future Improvements:** File storage, date handling, maintenance request tracking.
